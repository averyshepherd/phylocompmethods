# Phylogenetic Comparative Methods

## Introduction to phylogenies
Phylogenetic trees are branching diagrams illustrating the evolutionary relationships among taxa. 

* Each **node** represents a speciation event in evolution.
* A **branch** connects two nodes of the tree
* **Terminal Nodes** represent the data under comparison. Also known as **Operational Taxonomic Units** *(OTUs)*

# Introduction to Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs)
PCMs enable us to study the history of organismal evolution and diversification. With it we can explore in depth these topics:

* Evolutionary ties between organisms

* Find and understand relationships between an ancestral sequence and its descendants

* Estimate time of divergence between a group of organisms that share a common ancestor
