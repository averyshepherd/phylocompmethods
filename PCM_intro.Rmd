# Introduction to phylogenies
Phylogenetic trees are branching diagrams illustrating the evolutionary relationships among taxa. 
  * Each **node** represents a speciation event in evolution.
  * A **branch** connects two nodes of the tree
  * **Terminal Nodes** represent the data under comparison. Also known as **Operational Taxonomic Units** *(OTUs)*
